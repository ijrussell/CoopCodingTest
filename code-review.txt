Code Review of Coop.Interview.Api:

The playmultiple action has a bug where it returns the game result and the input error message for each iteration.

There are no tests.
It's difficult to test because of the Random number generator. 
Duplication of core game logic and game options between controller actions.
Lots of repeated magic strings.
It's hard to read the core game logic and difficult to check that it's correct. It will be even worse for Task 2 when there are more combinations.
Game logic should be moved from the controller actions.
Controller actions return Status Code 200 OK even if it returns the input error message. It should return a 400 Bad Request for invalid input.
Uses a non-recommended form of string concatenation (+).
Equality checking using the == operator requires that the strings match exactly, including case. It would be better to convert the player action to lower case or use String.Equals with a suitable StringComparison value.
The way the computer action is chosen is a little odd given that there is an overload of Next that takes the limit as the input parameter, so you could use the length of the actions collection.
As a minimum, the actions field should be marked as private readonly but it would be better to move the whole creation of actions and its contents to a new function outside the controller actions.
